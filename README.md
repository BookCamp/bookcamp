# Welcome to my second project made for ironhack

I had to create a project of a mobile & web app of a student social network to exchange books, information, etc. made with: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, Express.js, Passport, Nodemailer. I had to do it in a week, this was a job that was done in pairs and I had to present it in ironhack with my partner.

##  Experience :
It was an intense week, divided by tasks to be done by days, each day we made a different part of the application, we started on the CRUD routes and the truth is that you learn a lot doing this type of practice that allows you to demonstrate what you have learned and Many new things are learned that are generated at the code level and work in pairs as work is distributed and decisions are made.
